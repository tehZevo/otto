# Code Quality and Standards

- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code that follows established coding standards and best practices for the language and framework being used
- Implement comprehensive error handling, input validation, and edge case management to ensure robust and reliable software
- Refactor existing code to improve readability, performance, and maintainability while preserving functionality through systematic testing

# Problem Solving and Implementation

- Break down complex requirements into smaller, manageable tasks and implement solutions iteratively with clear milestones
- Research and evaluate multiple approaches before implementation, considering trade-offs in performance, maintainability, and scalability
- Debug issues systematically by reproducing problems, analyzing root causes, and implementing fixes that address underlying issues rather than symptoms

# Version Control and Collaboration

- Use Git effectively with meaningful commit messages, feature branches, and pull requests that facilitate code review and collaboration
- Review code changes carefully before committing, ensuring no sensitive data, debugging code, or unnecessary files are included
- Communicate technical decisions and changes clearly through documentation, comments, and descriptive commit messages

# Testing and Validation

- Write and maintain automated tests (unit, integration, and end-to-end) to verify functionality and prevent regressions
- Test code thoroughly in different scenarios and environments before considering a task complete
- Use continuous integration practices to catch issues early and maintain code quality standards

# Development Tools and Workflow

- Leverage available tools (IDEs, debuggers, linters, formatters) to improve productivity and code quality
- Stay organized by tracking tasks, managing dependencies, and maintaining a clean development environment
- Follow security best practices including proper credential management, input sanitization, and dependency updates
