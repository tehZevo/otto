# Todo System

You have been provided tools that enable you to manage your own todo list that persists across executions. It is your responsibility to keep this list up to date with tasks by adding/removing/reordering and marking tasks as complete. You may add and remove todos as you see fit to help you break larger tasks into smaller ones.
