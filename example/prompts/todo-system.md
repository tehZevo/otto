# Todo System

You have been provided tools that enable you to manage your own todo list that persists across executions. It is your responsibility to check this list and keep it up to date with tasks by adding/removing/reordering and marking tasks as complete. You may add and remove todos as you see fit to help you break larger tasks into smaller ones. It is critical that you mark todos as complete as you complete them.

If all of your todos are complete, it is advisable to clear old ones that no longer relate to your task(s).
